## 📘 Overview

This is the **frontend** component of the *Greenhouse Observer – IoT* project. It connects to the backend via **WebSockets** to visualize real-time environmental data like **temperature**, **gas levels**, and **light intensity** in a greenhouse.

Hosted on **Firebase**, the UI is responsive, fast, and designed for low-latency monitoring.
